#Write a program that takes as input 3 numbers; a, b and c and prints out two solutions to the quadratic equation. 
# ➤Use your program to compute the solution to  0.001x2 + 1000x + 0.001 = 0 
# ➤There is another way to write the quadratic equation if you multiply the numerator and denominator by -b ∓ √b2-4ac, you’ll get  
# ➤Add further lines to your program to also use this alternative solution. Do you get the same value for x? why?
